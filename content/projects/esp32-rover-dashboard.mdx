# ESP32 Rover Dashboard

Built at a UCLA summer hackathon: a React dashboard and Node.js backend controlling an ESP32 rover with ultrasonic sensors, live camera feed, and MQTT-based messaging.

## What I shipped

- Web UI for live telemetry, camera streaming, and directional controls routed through a Raspberry Pi.
- MQTT messaging layer for low-latency command/telemetry between the dashboard and the rover hardware.
- MicroPython firmware on the ESP32 handling motor PWM, ultrasonic sensing, and feedback loops.
- Designed and fabricated the rover chassis with laser-cut and 3D-printed parts to house sensors and camera.

## Result

Delivered an end-to-end demo that combined hardware, networking, and UI. Our team presented system design and integration to the judging panel, showing stable control and live feedback.
