# Tower Defense Engine

## Overview
Custom 2D tower defense engine written in Python with Pyglet. The goal is a clean, extensible architecture that keeps real-time simulation predictable while making it easy to add new content without touching core logic.

## Technical Highlights
- Object-oriented architecture for towers, enemies, projectiles, and levels
- Grid-based collision, targeting, and path-based movement
- Fixed-timestep game loop for consistent simulation
- YAML-driven configuration for levels, enemies, and balance
- Sprite batching and optimized rendering to maintain ~60 FPS

## Design Focus
Performance-aware, modular structure with strict separation of game logic from rendering so mechanics, balance, and assets can evolve without refactoring the engine core.
