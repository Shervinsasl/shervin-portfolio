# Rover Control System

## Overview
Distributed embedded system with a Raspberry Pi acting as the primary controller (networking, coordination, camera stream) and an ESP32 handling low-level sensors and I/O. MQTT links the layers so commands and telemetry flow in real time.

## Technical Highlights
- Raspberry Pi–based system controller for coordination and networking
- ESP32 firmware for ultrasonic sensors and low-level I/O
- MQTT publish/subscribe messaging for commands and telemetry
- Web-based dashboard for real-time control
- Asynchronous, event-driven system design
- Custom rover chassis fabrication

## Design Focus
Distributed system design with clear hardware–software boundaries and low-latency communication between the dashboard, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32.
