# AllExercises Platform

Full-stack event coordination platform built in a software construction course. I led the engineering effort, pairing a React frontend with a Django REST backend and secure token-based auth.

## Highlights

1. Event creation, tagging, and search backed by Django REST Framework.
2. Token-based authentication and protected routes to keep content scoped to logged-in users.
3. Coordinated schema, API design, and frontend integration across a 4-person team with Git workflows.
4. UI tuned for quick scanning of event details and tags so instructors and attendees can move fast.

## Impact

The platform streamlined how events were organized and discovered, and the clear API boundaries made it easy for the team to contribute without stepping on each other’s work.
