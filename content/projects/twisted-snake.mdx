# Twisted Snake

A 3D reimagining of Snake with free 360° camera control, AI-driven enemies, and pointer-locked controls using Three.js.

## Features

- Dynamic lighting, collision detection, and camera mechanics built on top of Three.js.
- Shader-based materials and particle effects for better visual feedback.
- AI enemies that change the pacing and add pressure to traditional Snake gameplay.
- Gameplay tuned for both keyboard and mouse with smooth camera orbiting.

## Takeaway

This project sharpened my understanding of WebGL fundamentals and how to manage state, performance, and input in a 3D browser game.
