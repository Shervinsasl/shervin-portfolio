# Twisted Snake

## Overview
3D interactive system built with Three.js, focused on free camera control, real-time rendering, and responsive gameplay loops.

## Technical Highlights
- Custom camera system with free rotation and pointer lock
- Real-time render loop with separated update and render phases
- AI-driven enemy behavior using simple state logic
- Collision detection via bounding volumes
- Shader-based materials and particle effects
- Dynamic lighting for scene composition

## Design Focus
Real-time systems thinking with modular structure and performance-aware rendering, so camera, simulation, and visuals stay decoupled and predictable.
