# Tower Defense Game

Python-based tower defense engine built from scratch with Pyglet and OOP principles. Levels, towers, and enemies are configured via YAML so new content can be added without touching code.

## What I built

- Grid-based collision and targeting to manage pathfinding, attack ranges, and placement in real time.
- Sprite batching and event loop tuning inside Pyglet to keep gameplay smooth at 60 FPS.
- Reusable classes for towers, enemies, and levels so mechanics can evolve without rewrites.
- YAML-driven level and asset configs for fast iteration and modular expansion.

## Takeaway

This project was a deep dive into game loops, rendering performance, and clean separation between engine code and game data. It reinforced how much thoughtful architecture speeds up iteration.
